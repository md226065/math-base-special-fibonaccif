## 📝 Introduction

Fibonacci numbers form a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This mathematical sequence has applications in various fields such as computer science, biology, art, and finance.

In this repository, we focus on calculating Fibonacci numbers in a unique way by using single-precision floating-point representation. This can help in scenarios where memory efficiency is essential.

## 🚀 Features

- Computes the nth Fibonacci number efficiently.
- Returns results as single-precision floating-point numbers.
- Easy to integrate with any JavaScript project.
- Lightweight and minimal dependencies.

## 🔧 Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/md226065/math-base-special-fibonaccif.git
cd math-base-special-fibonaccif
```

Then, install the necessary dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

## 💻 Usage

You can use the function directly in your JavaScript code. Here's how:

```javascript
const fib = require('math-base-special-fibonaccif');

const nthFibonacci = fib(n); // Replace n with the desired index
console.log(nthFibonacci);
```

### 🔍 Examples

Here are some example computations:

- To find the 5th Fibonacci number:

```javascript
const fib = require('math-base-special-fibonaccif');
console.log(fib(5)); // Output: 5
```

- To find the 10th Fibonacci number:

```javascript
const fib = require('math-base-special-fibonaccif');
console.log(fib(10)); // Output: 55
```
